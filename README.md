Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in files and manage different versions of a project. It allows developers to work on code safely, create branches for new features, restore previous versions, and collaborate with others without losing data.

GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories in the cloud. It provides tools for teamwork, sharing code, managing projects, reviewing changes (pull requests), and contributing to open-source software. GitHub makes it easy to store code online, collaborate with others, and build a developer portfolio.
